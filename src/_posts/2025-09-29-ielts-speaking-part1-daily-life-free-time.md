**IELTS Speaking Part 1: Daily Life & Free Time - Routine and Personal Preferences**
**IELTS スピーキング Part 1: 日常生活と自由時間 - ルーティンと個人的な好み**

---

**(Introduction)**

Daily life and free time topics are essential in IELTS Speaking Part 1 as they allow candidates to demonstrate their ability to discuss familiar, personal subjects. These questions help examiners assess your fluency when talking about routine activities, preferences, and lifestyle choices. Today I'm practicing responses that showcase natural conversation while highlighting personal details and experiences.

**(導入)**

日常生活と自由時間のトピックは、受験者が身近で個人的な話題について話す能力を示すことができるため、IELTS スピーキング Part 1 で重要です。これらの質問は、日常的な活動、好み、ライフスタイルの選択について話すときの流暢さを試験官が評価するのに役立ちます。今日は、個人的な詳細や経験を強調しながら自然な会話を示す回答を練習しています。

## Question 1: What do you usually do in the evenings?

**Improved Answer:**
"I usually finish work around 6 p.m. After that, I go home and start preparing dinner, like going shopping, washing rice, or making stir-fried vegetables. On weekends, we often go out for dinner. Our child loves a Japanese yakitori restaurant called Torikizoku, so we go there quite often. After dinner, we usually take our puppy, ChaCha, for a walk around the neighborhood. She’s a tiny poodle, only six months old, and she always enjoys being outside."

**Good points:**

- 具体的な流れ（finish work → dinner → walk puppy）が明確。
- 「Torikizoku」という固有名詞で個人的なエピソードを加えているのが good。

**Improvements:**

- “start to prepare our dinner, like go shopping” → 動詞の形をそろえて “preparing dinner, like going shopping” が自然。
- “walk our puppy. We walk our puppy…” → 繰り返しを避けて簡潔に。
- “the outside world so much” → “being outside” が自然。

## Question 2: Do you prefer spending time alone or with friends?

**Improved Answer:**
"If I had to choose, I’d say I prefer spending time alone. When I’m by myself, I usually study English or read articles on my MacBook. Since I work as a software engineer, I’m interested in keeping up with technology trends and the latest news in English."

**Good points:**

- 「study English」「technology trends」など話題が具体的で面接的に良い。
- "If I had to say" という言い回しも good。

**Improvements:**

- "read some articles using my MacBook" → “read articles on my MacBook” が自然。
- "catching up on the technology trends" → “keeping up with technology trends” の方がより自然。

## Question 3: How often do you exercise?

**Improved Answer:**
"These days, we play badminton about once every two weeks. We usually go to a gym run by Nara Prefecture, which takes about 20 minutes to get to by car. Our friends, the Kurisaki family, often join us, and we play badminton together for about two hours."

**Good points:**

- 頻度表現 “about once every two weeks” を使っていて good。
- “Kurisaki family” という具体例を出したのは自然な会話になる。

**Improvements:**

- “where Nara prefecture runs” → 文法的に誤り。“a gym run by Nara Prefecture” が正しい。
- “come there” より “join us” の方が自然。

## Question 4: What kind of TV programs do you enjoy watching?

**Improved Answer:**
"We rarely watch TV because it’s not really our hobby. But when we do, we enjoy documentaries and variety shows. For example, last week we watched _Sekai Gyoten News_, a Japanese program that covers international big news and explains the background stories of the people involved."

**Good points:**

- “documentary and variety” とジャンルを答えているのが good。
- 具体的な番組名を挙げているのは good。

**Improvements:**

- “we don’t have a hobby to do it” → 不自然。“it’s not really our hobby” か “we’re not in the habit of watching TV” が自然。
- “that shows about the international big news” → 不自然。“that covers international big news” が自然。
