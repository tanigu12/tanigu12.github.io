I'm thinking about the following question: Do you think that rich countries should do more to help poor countries develop?
Please help me to create my answer step by step.

# Step-by-step builder (use this to draft your answer)

## 1) State your opinion (be direct)

Choose one:

- **Yes, they should.**
- **Partly — yes, but the support must be smarter.** ✅ _(balanced, often scores well)_
- **Not necessarily.**

**Sentence starters**

- “**I’d say yes, but with conditions.**”
- “**To an extent, yes —** rich countries should help, **provided** the aid is effective and transparent.”

## 2) Give one strong reason + example

Pick ONE strong angle (don’t list too many):

- **Resources & responsibility:** They have capital, technology, and expertise.
- **Global stability:** Reducing poverty limits conflict, disease, and migration pressures.
- **Climate justice:** Rich countries emitted more; they should fund green development.

**Sentence starters**

- “**Firstly,** wealthy nations **have the resources** to make a real difference, **from technology transfer to infrastructure funding**.”
- “For example, **supporting renewable energy projects** or **training local teachers and nurses** can lift communities sustainably.”

## 3) Acknowledge the other side (show awareness)

Choose one caution:

- **Aid dependency** or poor governance can waste funds.
- Donors sometimes **push their own agenda**.
- Help shouldn’t **replace** local initiative or **domestic priorities**.

**Sentence starters**

- “**That said,** aid can **create dependency** if it bypasses local systems.”
- “**Another concern is accountability**—money must be tracked so it doesn’t vanish through corruption.”

## 4) Conclude with balance

Tie it up with a “yes, but smartly” line:

- “**So overall, yes—**but the focus should be **partnerships**, **capacity-building**, and **fair trade**, not endless handouts.”

**Sentence starters**

- “**In short,** rich countries **should help**, **but** through **transparent, long-term partnerships** that build local capacity.”

## Helpful IELTS linking phrases

- Opening: _In my view…; I’d argue that…_
- Adding: _To begin with…; In addition…_
- Contrasting: _However…; On the other hand…; That said…_

## Band-boosting vocabulary (use 2–3 naturally)

- **capacity-building**, **technology transfer**, **debt relief**, **good governance**, **accountability**, **sustainable development**, **targeted investment**, **trade access**, **conditionality**, **aid dependency**

## Pronunciation tips (quick)

# Plug-and-play template (fill the [brackets])

**1)** _[Yes/Partly]_, I think rich countries **should help**, **[but only if the support is effective]**.
**2)** **Firstly**, they have the **resources and technology** to speed up development — **for example, [renewable energy/teacher training/healthcare funding]**.
**3)** **However**, aid can **backfire** if it **creates dependency** or **lacks transparency**.
**4)** **So overall**, help is **necessary**, **but** it should focus on **partnerships, capacity-building, and fair trade**, not just **short-term handouts**.

---

# Model answer (≈35–45 seconds)

**I’d say yes, but with conditions.** Wealthy countries should support poorer nations because they have the capital and technology to accelerate progress, **for instance by funding clean energy and training local professionals**. **That said,** aid can **do more harm than good** if it breeds dependency or disappears through weak governance. **So overall,** rich countries **should help**, but the focus must be on **transparent, long-term partnerships**—things like **capacity-building, fair trade access, and technology transfer**—so that countries can **stand on their own feet** in the long run.
