I'm thinking about the following question: Should people without political experience, such as celebrities or athletes, be allowed to run in elections? Please help me to create my answer step by step.

Great topic! Let’s build a clear, IELTS-ready answer step by step using a simple 4-step logic. I’ll give you sentence starters and options; you can plug in your ideas and then try a full answer.

---

# Step 1 — State your opinion (clear position)

Pick one:

- **Yes (with conditions):**
  “Yes, they should be allowed, **as long as** there are strong checks and transparency.”
- **Partly (balanced):**
  “They should be allowed, **but** only if they meet certain standards, like policy knowledge and public debates.”
- **No (strict):**
  “No, I don’t think they should, **because** politics requires experience and technical competence.”

Useful openers: _“In my view… / I firmly believe… / To some extent…”_

---

# Step 2 — Give one strong reason (+ quick example)

Choose one core reason and add a short illustration:

- **Democracy & equal opportunity:**
  “In a democracy, any citizen should have the chance to run. For example, some outsiders bring fresh ideas and shake up stale systems.”
- **Transferable leadership skills:**
  “Celebrities or athletes often manage teams, budgets, and media; these skills can transfer to public office. For instance, leading a charity campaign shows real-world leadership.”
- **Representation & engagement:**
  “Famous figures can mobilize young voters and raise awareness of neglected issues, like mental health or sports funding.”

If you’re against, pick a different reason:

- **Policy complexity:**
  “Governing requires deep policy knowledge; without it, decisions can be shallow or harmful.”
- **Populism & name recognition bias:**
  “Voters might be swayed by fame rather than competence, which can distort results.”
- **Accountability & networks:**
  “Experienced politicians understand institutions and checks; newcomers may lack these networks and make mistakes.”

Linkers: _“The main reason is… / For instance… / This matters because…”_

---

# Step 3 — Acknowledge the other side (show balance)

- If you said **Yes/Partly**, concede a risk:
  “**Admittedly**, fame can overshadow substance, and some candidates rely on slogans instead of policy.”
- If you said **No**, concede a benefit:
  “**That said**, outsiders can bring fresh perspectives and challenge corruption.”

Linkers: _“Admittedly… / On the other hand… / I can see why some people argue that…”_

---

# Step 4 — Conclude with balance

- **Yes/Partly conclusion:**
  “**Overall**, they should be allowed, **provided that** they pass fair debates, disclose finances, and present detailed policies.”
- **No conclusion:**
  “**Overall**, the risks outweigh the benefits, so eligibility should depend on proven policy knowledge and public service experience.”

Closers: _“In short… / To sum up… / Ultimately…”_

---

## Plug-and-Play Template (fill the brackets)

1. **Opinion:** “(Yes / Partly / No), they (should / should not) be allowed to run, because (core reason).”
2. **Reason + Example:** “The main reason is (reason). For example, (short illustration).”
3. **Other side:** “Admittedly / On the other hand, (counterpoint).”
4. **Conclusion:** “Overall, (balanced summary) and (condition or recommendation).”

---

## Two Model Answers (you can imitate the rhythm)

### Model A — **Partly / With conditions**

“**Partly yes**—they should be allowed to run, **as long as** there are strong safeguards. **The main reason** is that democracy works best when it’s open: outsiders can bring fresh ideas and energize younger voters. **For example**, famous athletes who lead charities often show real leadership and communication skills. **Admittedly**, fame can overshadow substance, and some people vote for a name rather than a plan. **Overall**, they should be eligible, **provided that** they pass public policy debates, publish detailed platforms, and face strict financial transparency.”

### Model B — **No / Experience first**

“**No, not really.** Elections shouldn’t be a popularity contest. **The main reason** is that governing is technically complex; without experience, leaders may oversimplify serious issues. **For instance**, negotiating budgets or drafting legislation requires expertise and institutional know-how. **That said**, outsiders can challenge stale thinking and raise public interest. **Overall**, the risks outweigh the benefits, so candidates should demonstrate policy competence and a record of public service before running.”

## Useful Vocabulary & Phrases (B2–C1)

- **Governance / accountability / transparency / merit-based / populism / policy literacy**
- **“Name recognition can distort voter judgment.”**
- **“Set minimum competency benchmarks.”**
- **“Present a costed policy platform.”**
- **“Balance inclusivity with institutional stability.”**
