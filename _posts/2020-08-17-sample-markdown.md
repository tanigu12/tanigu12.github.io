# 🌱 Welcome to My Blog – A New Beginning

Hello and welcome to my blog!
I'm **Taka**, a Japanese software engineer born in 1991, and I'm really excited to begin this new journey of sharing my thoughts, experiences, and learning with you here.

## 👋 About Me

I work as a software engineer, and outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my adorable puppy and studying English.
I'm also very interested in watching games—not playing them, but observing how players move and react, especially in sports like rugby or video game competitions.

Since August 2024, I’ve been working on improving my English. It's been fun but also a bit challenging. One of my long-term dreams is to **become fluent in English** so I can express myself freely and connect with more people around the world.

## 💡 Why I Started This Blog

To be honest, **outputting**—writing, speaking, or even sharing my thoughts—has always been a challenge for me. I often feel embarrassed and give up halfway when writing articles. But I’ve realized something important:

> "If I can use generative AI as my partner, I can express myself more confidently."

So, I’ve decided to use this blog as a space to **organize my thoughts, track my progress, and practice sharing my ideas** in both English and Japanese.
This blog will be my **main place for output**—a record of what I learn, what I try, and how I grow.

## 📚 What You Can Expect

Here’s what you’ll find on this blog:

- My learning journey with English and programming
- Reflections on productivity, habits, and personal development
- Notes from books, videos, or experiences that inspired me
- Maybe some posts about my puppy or small daily joys

My goal is to post **at least once or twice a week**, even if it's just a small update or a short note. I believe consistency is more important than perfection.
